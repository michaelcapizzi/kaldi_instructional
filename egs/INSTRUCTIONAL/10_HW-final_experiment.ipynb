    "1. use existing acoustic and language models and just adjust *decoding* hyperparameters for `run_test.sh`: \n",

    "  1. Copy this notebook and rename it `10_HW_[your-last-name]-final_experiment.ipynb`.  This is **vital** so as not to create `git conflict`s!\n",

    "  3. Run the required notebooks with the appropriate configurations.\n",

    "  5. Save your finished `notebook` as `html`: `File` - `Download As` - `HTML`.\n",
    "  6. Link your `html` in http://uakaldiinstructional.mybb.us/viewtopic.php?id=7 **BEFORE** our next Friday meeting."
