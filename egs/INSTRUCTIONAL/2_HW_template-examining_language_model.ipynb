    "\n",
    "Using The `Comparing probabilities` section of `2_2-examining_language_model.ipynb` as an example, develop a case study that analyzes some aspect of language modeling.  This analysis can be done on our toy animal corpus **or** one of the `librispeech` language models.\n",

    "- impact of `4-gram` v. `3-gram` v. `2-gram`\n",
    "- impact of `start` and `stop` symbols\n",
    "- impact of `pruning` (would require analysis to be done on the `librispeech` language models as `pruning` isn't practical on our toy language models)\n"

    "\n",
    "  1. Copy this notebook and rename it `2_HW_[your-last-name]-examining_language_model.ipynb`.  This is **vital** so as not to create `git conflict`s!\n",
    "  2. Add your case study to the section below\n",
    "  3. Save your finished `notebook` as `html`: `File` - `Download As` - `HTML`.\n",
    "  4. Post your `html` file to http://uakaldiinstructional.mybb.us/viewtopic.php?id=3#p3 **BEFORE** our next Friday meeting."
