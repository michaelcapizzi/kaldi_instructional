    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `\"ate the {lion,mouse}\": updating weights` section of `7_2-examining_G_fst.ipynb` as an example, develop a case study that analyzes some manipulation of the `FST` representation of the `2-gram` language model using `openFST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While you are **more than welcome** to try an experiment with the `3-gram` language model, know that **most of the code** in `fst_manipulate.py` will **not work**.  So you'll have to do some coding of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    " - adjust the likelihood of a particular word (what if we wanted to bias our language model towards `\"mice\"`?)\n",
    " - adjust the likelihood of a particular `2-gram` (what if we wanted to bias our langauge model towards `\"mice  eating\"` things\"?) \n",
    " - remove a word from the language model (what if we just called it a `\"rex\"`?)\n",
    " - do you have another idea as to how to fix our `\"ate the {lion,mouse}\"` problem?"

    "\n",
    "  1. Copy this notebook and rename it `7_HW_[your-last-name]-examining_mfccs.ipynb`.  This is **vital** so as not to create `git conflict`s!\n",
    "  2. Add your case study to the section below\n",
    "  3. Save your finished `notebook` as `html`: `File` - `Download As` - `HTML`.\n",
    "  4. Post your `html` file to http://uakaldiinstructional.mybb.us/viewtopic.php?id=6#p6 **BEFORE** our next Friday meeting."
